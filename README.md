This repository is a companion to my research paper, titled "Studying the effect of spin removal in the Ising model".

MonteCarloGame.py simulates a game where the probability to win a round is p% and the game ends when you lose 2 rounds in a row, and your objective is to find the expected number of rounds before the game ends. It serves as an example of a Monte Carlo Simulation.

IsingModel.py is the code used for the simulations from the paper.

Figures.py is the code used to create Fig 1, 2 and 3.
